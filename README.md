Interesting graphics in Processing

## Lorentz attractor animation screenshot
The colour of the path through the phase-space changes with time as the attractor is traced out.

## Times tables patterns
These patterns are 'multiplication circles', a simple rule which gives amazing patterns! The Processing code can increment the multiplication number in steps of 0.05 to give a smooth transformation of the pattern as the number is increased. (Press w for + and q for -)
